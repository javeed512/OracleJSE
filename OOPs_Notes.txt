Inheritance 

For classes only multi level inheritance is possible , multiple inheritance not possible.

For interfaces both multi level inheritance  as well as multiple inheritance is  possible.


Abstraction:
-----------
Highligting set of services and hiding implementation code from the user.

Abstraction =  interfaces + abstract classes (implementation)




class   Machine {


	public abstract void  m1();  // abstract method

	public void m2(){
		
	// business logics


	}



}


Interface:
----------

End User: interface is set of services provided by service provider. It act like UI.

Developers: Interface is nothing but specification/requirement. 
             which developers need to implements



interface  Bank {

	// only abstract methods

	void withdraw();

}


class BankImp  implements Bank{


	void withdraw(){


	}


}


interface I1,I2,I3


public interface I1 extends I2,I3{



}

IBank  b = new BankImp2();
